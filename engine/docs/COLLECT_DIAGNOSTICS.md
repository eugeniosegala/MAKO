# Collect MAKO Renderer Diagnostics

For standalone installations using `mako-launch`. If you use `mako-run`, follow the [MAKO Decky guide](../../plugin/docs/COLLECT_DIAGNOSTICS.md).

## 1. Enable logs

Fully close the game and save its current launch settings so you can restore them afterward.

**Steam or Proton:** temporarily use these Launch Options:

```text
MAKO_PRESENT_DIAGNOSTICS=1 MAKO_PRESENT_DIAGNOSTICS_THRESHOLD_MS=25 ~/.local/bin/mako-launch %command%
```

For a system installation, use your normal `mako-launch` path.

**Heroic, Lutris or Flatpak:** keep your working setup and add these per-game environment variables:

```text
MAKO_PRESENT_DIAGNOSTICS=1
MAKO_PRESENT_DIAGNOSTICS_THRESHOLD_MS=25
```

**Terminal launch:** capture the game output:

```bash
MAKO_PRESENT_DIAGNOSTICS=1 MAKO_PRESENT_DIAGNOSTICS_THRESHOLD_MS=25 \
    mako-launch your-game-command 2>&1 | tee "$HOME/Desktop/MAKO-renderer-session.log"
```

Replace `your-game-command` with your normal game command.

## 2. Reproduce the problem

Start the game, reproduce the issue once, note what happened and fully exit. Collect the report before another test run.

## 3. Save the report

In Desktop Mode, open Konsole and run:

```bash
mako-diagnostics --lines 2000 all > "$HOME/Desktop/MAKO-diagnostics.txt" 2>&1
```

If the command is not found, try `~/.local/bin/mako-diagnostics` instead. For the terminal capture above, add `--log "$HOME/Desktop/MAKO-renderer-session.log"` before `--lines`.

The file appears on your Desktop; Konsole normally prints nothing. If no log is found, check the temporary launch settings and repeat the test.

## 4. Restore your settings

Restore the original launch settings and remove the two temporary diagnostics variables.

## 5. Send the report

Review `MAKO-diagnostics.txt` and remove personal information. Upload it through the [diagnostic form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScSd9qgkYCq3Kbbc3_52k4_82iTmEqt3_FxOqGuxQ6FsjutgA/viewform), choosing **MAKO Renderer (standalone/direct installation)**. Answer **Unknown** when unsure. Do not post the log publicly or attach `Lossless.dll`.
